# Scality AI Connector

An accelerated engine of the NIXL OBJ backend for Scality AI Connector
endpoints. Each transfer is split into two planes:

- **Data plane (RDMA):** the object bytes move directly between the local
  buffer (DRAM or GPU memory) and the storage server over RDMA DC (Dynamically
  Connected), zero-copy, so GPU memory needs no staging copy through the host.
  The storage server performs the one-sided RDMA operations; this side only
  registers memory.
- **Control plane (HTTP):** a header-only request tells the server *what* to do
  (`PUT`/`GET` of an object). The RDMA descriptor, which describes the registered
  buffer range, travels in an `x-scal-rdma` header. The body is empty. The
  RDMA descriptor is fully compatible with the cuObject one: the connector
  builds it itself with libibverbs, in the same DC format the cuObject library
  generates, so a server that accepts cuObject descriptors accepts it unchanged.

```text
  local buffer (DRAM/VRAM) <----- RDMA (server-driven) -----> Scality endpoint
                                                                   ^
  control: HTTP PUT/GET {endpoint}/{object_id}                     |
           header  x-scal-rdma: <descriptor> ----------------------+
           body    (empty)
```

The connector speaks Scality's own REST dialect. It is **not** an S3 client and
uses neither the AWS SDK nor AWS authentication.

## Prerequisites

- An RDMA NIC with DC support (NVIDIA ConnectX, `mlx5`), reachable by the
  Scality endpoint.
- For GPU memory, one of:
  - DMA-BUF, used first: Linux 5.12 or later and an NVIDIA driver that exports
    DMA-BUF (typically the open kernel modules);
  - the `nvidia_peermem` kernel module (GPUDirect RDMA peer memory), used when
    DMA-BUF is not available.

- A reachable Scality AI Connector endpoint.
- Build dependencies: `libcurl`, `libibverbs` and `libmlx5`.

## Building

The engine is part of NIXL's standard Meson build and is compiled into the OBJ
plugin when its dependencies are found at configure time:

```sh
meson setup build
ninja -C build
```

Otherwise it is skipped, and selecting it at run time reports
`Accelerated engine type 'scality_ai_connector' is not available (not compiled)`.

## Configuration

The engine is selected and configured through the backend's `customParams`.

**Required**

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `accelerated` | Must be `"true"` to request an accelerated engine |
| `type` | Must be `"scality_ai_connector"` to select this engine |
| `endpoint_override` | Base URL of the connector, e.g. `http://10.0.0.1:10000` |

**HTTP requests (optional)**

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `max_inflight` | `min(512, RLIMIT_NOFILE / 4)` | Cap on requests running at once. Each holds a connection and therefore a file descriptor, so the default is clamped to a share of `RLIMIT_NOFILE`; excess requests queue and start as slots free. `0` disables the cap. |
| `num_threads` | `max(2, cpu_threads / 4)` | Size of the callback worker pool (see [Concurrency model](#concurrency-model)). |
| `request_timeout_ms` | `2000` | Limit on each request, connection included (connecting itself is limited to 1 s). A stalled request fails after this instead of holding its transfer; for a cache, falling back is faster than waiting. |

**Transfers (optional)**

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `dram_rdma` | `true` | Whether DRAM transfers use RDMA. With `false`, a DRAM READ uses a plain HTTP GET with nothing pinned: no MR, and no NIC list needed at all. A DRAM WRITE is refused, because there is no plain-HTTP upload. This is for callers whose host buffers hold metadata, where an `ibv_reg_mr` per rail costs more than the read itself. VRAM always uses RDMA. |
| `split_size` | `8388608` (8 MiB) | Bytes per object request. A READ descriptor of any size is cut into requests of at most this, on boundaries aligned in the object's own offset space. Pieces past the end of a shorter object read nothing. WRITE is never split. `0` disables splitting. |

**RDMA (optional)**

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `rdma_dc_key` | from `cufile.json`, else `0xffeeddcc` | DC access key the server's DCI side must present, in hex (e.g. `0xffeeddcc`). |
| `rdma_nics` | from `cufile.json` | NICs to register memory on: comma-separated IPv4 addresses or device names, e.g. `10.10.40.208,10.10.48.208` or `mlx5_1,mlx5_2`. |
| `rdma_sl` | `3` | RoCE service level (0-15). Selects the egress priority under PCP trust. See [RoCE priority](#roce-priority). |
| `rdma_traffic_class` | `106` | RoCE traffic class, the IP ToS byte (0-255, DSCP = value >> 2). Selects the priority under DSCP trust. See [RoCE priority](#roce-priority). |

Requests are issued to `{endpoint_override}/{object_id}`.

Example (parameters as passed to the OBJ backend):

```ini
accelerated       = true
type              = scality_ai_connector
endpoint_override = http://10.0.0.1:10000
rdma_nics         = mlx5_1,mlx5_2
```

When `rdma_nics` or `rdma_dc_key` is unset, the value is read from the
`rdma_dev_addr_list` and `rdma_dc_key` keys of `cufile.json`
(`$CUFILE_ENV_PATH_JSON`, else `/etc/cufile.json`), so a host already configured
for GPUDirect Storage RDMA needs no extra settings. The NIC list is only needed
once DRAM or VRAM is registered.

## Example

This Python example writes a GPU buffer to an object, then reads the object back
into the buffer.

```python
import torch
from nixl import nixl_agent, nixl_agent_config

agent = nixl_agent("client", nixl_agent_config(backends=[]))
agent.create_backend(
    "OBJ",
    {
        "accelerated": "true",
        "type": "scality_ai_connector",
        "endpoint_override": "http://10.0.0.1:10000",
        "rdma_nics": "mlx5_1,mlx5_2",
    },
)

size = 8 * 1024 * 1024
buf = torch.ones(size, dtype=torch.uint8, device="cuda:0")
local = agent.register_memory(buf)
# One object with the key "block-0". Transfers refer to it by its device ID, 0.
obj = agent.register_memory([(0, size, 0, "block-0")], "OBJ")


def run(op):
    # The NIC reads and writes the buffer outside the CUDA stream, so the GPU work
    # on the buffer must be finished first.
    torch.cuda.synchronize(buf.device)
    # The remote agent is the agent itself: the object store is local to it.
    handle = agent.initialize_xfer(op, local.trim(), obj.trim(), "client")
    state = agent.transfer(handle)
    while state == "PROC":
        state = agent.check_xfer_state(handle)
    agent.release_xfer_handle(handle)
    assert state == "DONE", f"{op} failed"


run("WRITE")  # buffer -> object
buf.zero_()
run("READ")  # object -> buffer
assert bool((buf == 1).all())

agent.deregister_memory(obj)
agent.deregister_memory(local)
```

## Concurrency model

A single poller thread drives all HTTP requests through libcurl's multi
interface, so the in-flight request count does not depend on `num_threads`
(the bulk data moves over RDMA; HTTP only carries the header-only command). Each
completed request's callback runs in a worker pool sized by `num_threads`, so a
slow callback cannot stall the poller. The default is sufficient for
lightweight callbacks.

At most `max_inflight` requests run at once; the rest wait in a queue and start
as running ones complete. At teardown the client logs the peak number of
running and waiting requests: a non-zero `peak_pending` means the cap was the
binding constraint.

The cap is per backend instance, and every running request holds its own
connection. A host running N workers (for example one vLLM process per GPU,
each with its own NIXL agent) therefore opens up to N × `max_inflight`
connections to the endpoint: 16 workers at the default of 512 is 8192. If the
endpoint limits connections per client, lower `max_inflight` accordingly.

## Multi-NIC

The connector opens one DC target per NIC. It registers each buffer on each NIC
that the buffer can use (see below), with one memory region per NIC that covers
the whole buffer. The NIC a request travels on is chosen when its RDMA descriptor
is built, so consecutive requests against one buffer spread across the rails:
each request goes to the NIC that has carried the fewest so far. With `split_size`,
a single large READ descriptor is enough to reach every NIC.

GPU memory uses only the NICs affine to its GPU: the ones sharing its PCIe
switch when such a NIC exists, else every NIC on the GPU's NUMA node. GPU memory
uses NICs on other NUMA nodes only in these cases:

- no NIC is on the GPU's NUMA node: the buffer uses all the NICs;
- the GPU's NUMA node is unknown: the buffer uses all the NICs;
- none of the affine NICs could register the buffer: the buffer uses the other
  NICs.

Host memory has no affinity and spreads over all NICs, on every NUMA node.

Bonded (LAG) NICs are detected from sysfs; one DCT QP is created per physical
port and RDMA descriptors cycle through them, so the distinct DCT numbers feed the
hardware bond hash (DCT QPs cannot be pinned to a physical port directly).

## RoCE priority

The defaults follow NVIDIA's standard lossless RoCE configuration: RoCE on
priority 3 with PFC enabled, marked DSCP 26. `rdma_sl=3` selects priority 3
when switches and NICs trust PCP (VLAN-tagged traffic); `rdma_traffic_class=106`
(DSCP 26 plus the ECN-capable bit) selects it when they trust DSCP. On a fabric
configured differently, set both to match it.

These settings only mark what this side sends: the data of a WRITE, which the
server reads from the local buffer, and RDMA acknowledgements. The data of a
READ is written into the local buffer by the server, so its priority follows
the server's own RoCE settings.

## How a transfer works

1. **Register memory.** Local DRAM or VRAM buffers are registered for RDMA on
   the NICs they can use (see [Multi-NIC](#multi-nic)); remote object segments
   are mapped to their object ids.
2. **Prepare.** For each piece of the transfer the connector builds an RDMA
   descriptor for the buffer range (no data moves yet).
3. **Post.** It issues the HTTP `PUT`/`GET` for the object id, carrying the
   RDMA descriptor in the `x-scal-rdma` header, and returns immediately. The server
   performs the RDMA read or write on the buffer.
4. **Poll.** The transfer is checked for completion until all parts succeed or
   one reports an error.

## Limitations

- **DC transport only**; there is no RC fallback.
- The cuObject RDMA descriptor's SIZE field is 32 bits, so a single request is
  at most 4 GiB - 1 byte (0xFFFFFFFF == 4294967295).
  A READ stays below it as long as `split_size` does; a WRITE, which is never
  split, is limited to 4 GiB - 1 byte per descriptor.
- A WRITE creates or replaces the whole object; there is no partial-object
  write. Whether an existing key can be overwritten depends on the endpoint's
  configuration.
- A buffer can be registered more than once only with the same address and
  length. A registration that starts at the same address as an existing one but
  has a different length is refused. Register the buffer once, or register
  sub-ranges that start at different addresses.
- After a failed or timed-out request the server may still complete its RDMA on
  the buffer, so do not reuse the buffer for other data.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom (in logs) | Potential cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `'endpoint_override' parameter is required` | Set `endpoint_override` in `customParams`. |
| `RDMA requires a NIC list` | Set `rdma_nics`, or `rdma_dev_addr_list` in `cufile.json`. |
| `ibverbs_dc: no RDMA device found for NIC` | The IPv4 address or device name matches no local RDMA device. |
| `ibverbs_dc: ibv_reg_mr failed on <nic>` for VRAM | Neither registration path works for GPU memory: load `nvidia_peermem`, or use a kernel and NVIDIA driver with DMA-BUF support. |
| `restClient: first connect failure. fds open=...` | Open descriptors close to the soft limit: lower `max_inflight` or raise `ulimit -n`. Far below it: the endpoint could not be reached; see the `curl says` text in the log. |
| `<op>: failed url=<url> curl_code=<n> http_code=<n>` | The HTTP call failed. A non-2xx `http_code` comes from the server; check the object id and endpoint URL. |
