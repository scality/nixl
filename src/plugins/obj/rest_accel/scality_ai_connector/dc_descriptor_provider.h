 * In-process libibverbs DC (Dynamically Connected) RDMA descriptor provider.
 *
 * Opens one DC target per NIC and registers every buffer on all of them, so a
 * request against any buffer can travel on any rail. An rkey covers any
 * sub-range of its MR, so the NIC a request uses is picked when its RDMA
 * descriptor is built: see pickRail. VRAM requests use only the NICs affine to
 * their GPU.
 *
 * The DC target is passive: the server (DCI side) initiates and performs all
 * one-sided RDMA, so this client runs no background threads, CM listener, or CQ
 * polling.
